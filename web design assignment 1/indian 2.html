            <b> How to serve lamb biryani: </b> 
            Biryani is always treated as the star of the show and we tend not to serve any curries alongside it. It is classically served with a raita so you can enjoy the different layers of flavour.

        <h2> Method </h2>
        <h3> Step 1 </h3>
        <p>
            Put all the biryani garam masala ingredients in a spice grinder with 2 tsp salt. Grind into a powder and set aside.
        </p>
        <h3> Step 2 </h3>
        <p>
            Now, make the lamb marinade. Put all the ingredients in a bowl, add the ground garam masala and mix until well incorporated. Cover and allow to marinate in the fridge for a minimum of 2 hrs, or ideally overnight. Remove from fridge once you start preparing the biryani.
        </p>
        <h3> Step 3 </h3>
        <p>
            Heat the oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7. Wash the rice 4-5 times, or until the water runs clear. Set aside. Add around 2 liters of water to a large pot and bring to a boil.
        </p>
        <h3> Step 4 </h3>
        <p>
            Add the rice, remaining rice ingredients and 1 tsp salt to the water. Mix well and allow the water to come back up to the boil. Reduce to a rolling simmer and mix the rice every couple of minutes. Cook for 6-9 minutes or until the rice is partially cooked - it should have a bite to it. Drain and keep covered with foil or tha pan lid.
        </p>
        <h3> Step 5 </h3>
        <p>
            To make the saffron cream, bring the milk, cream and ghee to the boil in a small saucepan. As soon as it boils, turn off the heat. Add the saffron strands. Allow the saffron to infuse well (the milk will turn yellow). Add 1/4 tsp salt and mix. Set aside.
        </p>
        <h3> Step 6 </h3>
        <p>
            Put the marinated lamb in a large ovenproof dish with a lid. Put the partially cooked rice on top and spread evenly. Sprinkle over the golden fried onions, coriander, mint and saffron cream.
        </p>
        <h3> Step 7 </h3>
        <p>
            Cover with foil and put the lid on top. Cook in the oven for 20 mins, then reduce the temperature to 160C/fan 140C/gas 3 and cook for a further 50 minutes. Check the lamb is cooked and then remove from oven.
        </p>
        <h3> Step 8 </h3>
        <p>
            Carefully mix the layers with a large spoon before serving. Garnish with the  cranberries or pomegranate seeds. Serve with a raita of your choice.
